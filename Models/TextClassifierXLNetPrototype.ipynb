umm it's set in france and it's definitely subtitled so if you're not a fan of sub titles you're gonna want to steer clear of this one umm if you don't mind subtitles and you're into foreign films i would still say don't get your hopes up it's just it really isn't that good honestly i was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for this film to be over it was long it it stutter drew on and on umm in typical foreign film fashion it was all about character development and all about the background story and getting to know people and you know generally i don't mind that but when it's in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of actually umm the basic plot of the story is that this guy franco is a film maker and he's worried about uhh getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy so he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and franco's forced to flee his country he has to leave umm because he's kind of been indicted for some things he's not looking very good he's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland umm so he leaves and in his new city he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says well can you film my daughter's wedding and franco says sure i'll do that and basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married so it's kind of it's all out there it's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl and it kind of doesn't really fit together umm i think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long drawn out and ridiculous film i think it would be enough to swallow umm the whole scandal thing and i can't i can't stutter even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in depth and so umm convoluted and messy you just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself umm in order to figure it all out and even for myself i still wonder if i got the whole thing right it's that messy umm and that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge that happened because of it it it stutter could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation umm when you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one it's just to much to digest it would have took me another two or three uhh just to to stutter figure this out and i don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated foreign or not i mean entertainment value here is what i want and that's not what i was given in this film at all i'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating umm i can't think of anything uhh for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating umm if they would've broken it up i mean then it's just different films so you can't even it's comparing apples to oranges kind of umm but that would've been a better alternative to what they did here umm i i've stutter seen some foreign film lately that i really enjoyed i really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters but this one was kind of and weird and out there and just not worth my time again one out of five stars don't waste your time seeing it in a theater don't even waste your time renting this one it's just not worth it there are much better foreign films out

the question what is a a is a new kind of term and we know what traditional equities are we think that are going to be something pretty different there's a lot of different definitions going around and it's kind of up in the air so in many senses it's what we make of it at this stage but there's a couple things that we know it is right off the bat we have counterparty assets counterparty assets are digital assets they don't take up space per say or they might but they aren't managed by a central authority in some ways they're kind of parallel to what you would see perhaps in a model with domain names being handled as a scarce resource by the of course in the case of counterparty and of course in the case of there is no central holder or central clearing house or central repository for these equities they exist as assets assets themselves are up to users to define and you can call these assets whatever you'd like in traditional equity terms we have things like stocks so maybe you have a website venture or maybe you have a new funded or venture that you want to do you can define shares you can define the name of your company as an asset name and you can declare that to the network and you can declare that as having x number of shares maybe you have shares or shares maybe these are non divisible shares thee are non divisible in the sense that they don't have sub units they are just tokens that are themselves a percentage of a a whole those would be a very bare bones definition of what a is but it goes a little bit further from there can also be things like tied to tangible goods maybe you have a bank of gold or copper or some such thing and you want to declare to the network that you are the holder of that repository that it is yours but the equity itself is decentralized and it is declared on the network and it represents some fractional holding of that store of that traditional commodity in some senses in that case it's a bit centralized and requires trust upon the person declaring the asset but certainly is doesn't require trust on the part of the clearinghouse or the counterparty agent that would be another use for but there's more exotic definitions of as well these could be things such as karma perhaps maybe what you do is on a type site you issue karma for people who contribute content this content is itself a fractional share of perhaps the advertising revenue that would also be a new form of and we don't really know where this is going but these are the types of things that people can start doing with counterparty with and these are the types of directions that people will take right now there is a project which is a bridge between the old world of equities and the new world of that project is still in development it's too soon to talk about and we will see what happens but you'll start to see the divide between equity in traditional shares and safe models and the model start to blur perhaps over time what we can be certain of is that are decentralized they are tied to the security of the network in terms of a scarcity and they will be available through protocols like if not certainly counterparty and they will be done by people like yourselves so go ahead and create your own show us how this is going to work in the modern world and show us what you're doing with it in fact when you do it let us know send an

government in which it operates or it is built and run by the federal government on behalf of the state in which it operates the other kind of is a private exchange which is the same concept a website in which you can buy an qualified health plan but it is built and run by a private company private exchanges offer many advantages over the public option for starters when you're dealing with a private company you will not only have access to every plan available under but you will also have many other plans from insurance carriers who are choosing to not participate in you also get the

another edition of digital marketing news for the busy marketer the latest information on digital marketing that you need to know right now our story today comes from yesterday announced more video updates this time taking some plays out of book the first update which will be rolling out this week is the addition of a view count on videos so down at the bottom of every video you'll see a number of likes number of comments and number of views according to will be shown on public videos from people and pages to help people discover new popular the first thing that popped in my mind when i read this was how is this going to affect small businesses and small organizations that don't have a large following will people be less likely to view a video with a dozen views when they're used to seeing viral videos or even videos from large organizations with thousands of views i was a little turned off with the statement help people discover new popular in the same press release talks about how video ranking in news feed was improved a few months ago to show people more relevant and interesting videos so how exactly does showing the number of views help since they already have an algorithm in place to get appropriate videos in front of people and what exactly counts as a view when a video appears in most peoples news feed it auto plays if an auto play counts as a view then organizations with hundreds of thousands of followers are going to naturally show a high number of views because it's showing up in the news feed of many of their followers one of the things i love about social media is at least in the beginning it leveled the playing field small organizations could run grassroots marketing and had a chance against the large corporations a businesses could be shown in the same feed with the wal marts of the world it seems with every update to the balance swings more and more in favor of the companies with the biggest budgets the cynic in me has to question whether this is a play to get more pages to buy advertising to get their video views up is it just me let me know by leaving a comment below the next update to video is the addition of related videos this is a feature that they're currently testing on mobile similar to when the video finishes playing users will be shown additional related videos i believe this is probably a good thing for users i know that i use that feature often on what this means to businesses and organizations is now there's a very good chance that your competition can be shown to your fans that's the part that pains me the most and raises a few more questions if i go through the time and expense to grow an audience on and i put out a video am i going to be exposing that audience to my competition because they have a

is generally theaters have on staff on their normal everyday staff a series of technical people from the technical director to carpenters and all that and then sometimes they get so much work in they hire other local carpenters to come in for extra work so it's beyond their normal hire so so a noise within has a technical director and then they hire a bunch of carpenters and we're technically overhear so they give us the schedule of like these are the build days can you make it yeah sure alright come in oh wait no we booked up that type of thing that's what i have on the books right now

go into a store how they respond to marketing stimuli like prices advertising displays and things like that how do they make the brain choices that they do how do they consume products how do they choose among different retailers so really essentially problems of choice and in very traditional settings and then i would say perhaps in the last four or five years i've now got really interested in internet retailing and how people connect over the internet people connect from different communities because i think a traditional retailing you face two constraints so constraint number one is once you locate a store in a certain region you've really defined you're trading area so retailing we always used to say location location location is very important nobody is driving from new york city to philadelphia to do their supermarket shopping so that's the first constraint the second constraint you face is the constraint of what kind of products you can offer on the shelf you have a fixed amount of space and so you have to really carry stuff that's popular so what's interesting about the internet is both of those constraints are now gone so if i'm i can sell diapers to people in texas in california in new york simultaneously how does that change things if i'm maybe i can offer a far greater assortment of diaper products than any one local supermarket could also offer so those are really the two changes going into that world that i became interested in the first thing that's interesting is how the consumers actually relate to each other and so i'm very very interested to see how consumers start conversations about particular products about particular services about particular environments and then the second thing i think is interesting is the relationship between how they sit virtually and how sit physically so for example if people propagate word of mouth potentially i could send you an email if i'm in los angeles and you're in new york but maybe when i propagate word of mouth i just talk to my friends who live within the same few blocks that i live in los angeles so it's very very interesting to me how this physical world and the virtual world to what extent do they overlap and how do they reinforce each other one of the implications is if you want to create word of mouth which has the feedback like once it gets going it starts to sort of build on itself you probably want to try and identify physical communities that have properties that are conducive to word of mouth so maybe you need people who live densely closely together or maybe you want to go into a community where there's a lot of so called social capital meaning that people meet each other at the tennis club they go to church together they drink at the same bar so places where people have connection whereas if you want to contact people living in more rural or more spread out kind of environments maybe the way you reach them is through keyword search and other kinds of tools so i think using the physical characteristics of the community to identify places that the more conducive to word of mouth versus other tools<sep><cls>\n","tensor([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.,

act of playing and the act and the act of watching are nearly the same thing it's like how you don't have to drive the jeep through the jungle safari to see all the zoo animals moreover there's

that we're working with in order to release it and to reset the pain mechanism now in order to understand how this technique works you have to understand a little bit about the anatomy of the body there are a lot of different way we perceive pain in the body one of the ways is through damage to the anatomy another way is through stretch if you stretch something too far your stretch receptor is going to send back a message to the brain that will say hey don't do that it hurts so what this does is sometimes we'll make a quick movement and the stretch receptor gets set to too short so what's happening is when you're at a normal stretch its sending a message to the brain saying hey don't do that it hurts and so what we do is jones came up with a great technique that resets the stretch

worse actors than they had back in the day umm they were actually really good in twilight zone this is this is stutter that was a insult to the twilight zone this is a terrible movie umm i know people

stutter doesn't know what he's doing any more the sixth sense was a beautiful movie it was a beautiful film i love that film uhh was pretty good uhh signs awesome uhh and then there came the village

level of a diffusion index based on surveyed managers excluding the manufacturing industry in the united states if the report is above it indicates industry expansion and below indicates contraction this index is based on surveys of more than non manufacturing managers within sectors across the united states by the institute of supply management the last index that was released in january registered percent percent lower than december's reading of percent this indicates continued growth at a slightly slower rate in the non manufacturing sector so why does this matter to you first it is a leading indicator of economic health secondly businesses react quickly to market conditions and their managers hold perhaps the most current and relevant insight into the company's view of the economy when this index is increasing investors can assume that the stock markets should increase because of higher corporate profits the opposite can be thought of the bond markets which may decrease as this index increases because of sensitivity to potential inflation so how does this affect your trading for traders this data may be useful for examining the status of the industries in which they hold their investments and examining the trends taking place in that corner of the market this indicator is gaining more and more attention with every release providing insight into business areas

university of texas at austin's mccombs school of business and welcome to this version of the macro updates last night president gave a speech that did many things including talking about his future economic policies i want to take a look at some of the suggestions president laid out and what sort of missing in a lot of the press coverage one of the things that we see the press constantly talking about is this issue of potential nationalization of the banks our financial institutions have gotten themselves into so much trouble that maybe the only answer is that the government takes them over but if you look at president speech last night he made it clear that that's really not the path he intends on taking instead he discussed the need for potential more funding of banks but to hold those banks responsible for that length or for the money that they get to try to ensure that they actually lend that money to individuals to businesses and so on now there weren't a whole lot of specifics on how exactly he is going to do that so i think it would be very interesting to look and keep an eye on what the next phase of bank bailouts are going to be and how specifically is he going to force those banks to lend the second issue that brings up and i think one that needs to be looked at very very carefully is he talks about creating a new lending fund that is going to ensure that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs it's going to be very interesting to see what exactly does he mean by that does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks if so is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system to try to get those banks to start lending i think it's going to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund another thing that addressed in his discussion and has talked about before is the mortgage bailout he specifically said again and again and again that his policies are going to be aimed to make sure that speculators don't benefit nor our people who have bought homes that they could not afford they also are not going to benefit from the bailout well how exactly is that going to take place who is going to make that decision on who exactly was a speculator or who is going to make the decision on who bought a home that they could not afford does this mean that we are going to potentially change our bankruptcy laws if so that could take a long time to work through congress and also how this is going to affect our various bankruptcy laws and bankruptcy courts and finally another thing that touched upon was he called on congress to quote reform our outdated regulatory system close quote and again this is a major undertaking the bush administration had put forward a plan that was very very murky didn't have a correct alignment of incentives and so on it's also be very interesting to see what exactly does the administration have in mind in terms of what the new regulatory system is going to look like in the future so while his speech last night was short on specifics of how exactly he is going to achieve these things that in many ways understandable but it will be interesting to watch what exactly will the new bailout for the banks look like what exactly is this new lending fund mean how exactly with the mortgage bailout is he going to make sure that speculators and people who paid too much for homes don't benefit and what exactly does regulatory reform mean in the future i think there's these are very interesting things to watch as the future of our financial markets and financial market regulations unfold until next time i'm mike brandl from the university of texas at austin thanks for tuning in music<sep><cls>\n","tensor([[-0.3333,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.6667,  0.0000,  0.0000,

stutter wasn't that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were i had already seen cause they were in the commercials so if you own a tv and you saw the commercials i wouldn't recommend seeing the movie and even if you didn't see the commercials i wouldn't really recommend the movie i mean i love the simpsons and pretty much they're always funny some people don't like the current seasons but i still think that they're pretty funny and i was really let down by the movie so i mean the whole plot was kind of stupid they're trying to save springfield stutter i guess i didn't like the plot so once the plot got ruined i really didn't care the movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long it was definitely a comedy and i guess if you're a true simpsons fan you're gonna wanna see the movie but you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks so if you're thinking about seeing it i wouldn't recommend it maybe rent it that's probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it i wouldn't really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show and the shows are free so i give the movie probably two out of

week then i was going to have to find a better way so i go to and i search how to schedule a video to post on and amy was there with a tutorial i went and looked up how to do something else and amy was there with a tutorial every question it felt like that i had about how to do something on amy had a tutorial she was out there providing value and showing her expertise in a way that was truly helpful for what i needed so i became a fan immediately her videos were not only informative they were also entertaining and that led to me binge watching them she's got and some i haven't seen them all i'm sure but i've watched a lot of them because i was learning something with each new video one thing that i really picked up on and i didn't know it was a thing was the way she structured her videos her short intro immediately giving you all the information you need a call to action and end it so there's not all this extra fluff in her videos oh and look there it is right there on page it's amy's authority video formula all about how to do a video and i have borrowed from it heavily it's why you'll notice now in my videos i try to really just jump into the content cut to the chase and not give a whole bunch of fluff and talk about whatever i was talking about in those early videos that probably had nothing to do with amazon or selling on amazon it's also why i end with a much

leave me a comment like this video check out the checklist here's my handle let me spell my email address for you i don't know what i was thinking so thank you amy because i needed that amy's videos

what do you do about it and how do you live best on it and with it and i think um yeah i was striving for more of a well rounded perspective on those issues and i wasn't getting it from the church and that um made me really sad you know you grow up in it people who love you and you love it and it's you want to reconcile those two things coming here actually i met a lot of fellow students and good professors who were really passionate about how to live practically in the world whether that is solving food desert issues or whether that is going abroad and purifying water and stuff like that i think it just got me really interested and i saw that practical living out that i was looking for earlier and then i went back home and looked for ways to do it too and got involved in urban farming like you were talking about with the leaders i think it is important to get them on board i think a lot of people on churches look to them strongly as perhaps they should for advice and leadership on

analyze your map create maps it is the workhorse of the program the second component is is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different change projection added everything like that and then the last part the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course where we get into looking at very specific tools also in this module we start to really dive into the world of spatial data make sure you pay attention to the difference between our two key types of spatial data models vector and raster data make sure you know the difference between the two but also know how each data model represents the real world in the computer program so what are the differences how did the final products look different and pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models the last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to and in general so pay attention to the key concepts and key terms because they come up throughout the semester and throughout the time that you are exposed to software make sure you understand the difference between layers and features and and feature classes classes and feature classes and feature we also talk about the importance of attributes attributes are really are what set apart software and just a paper map showing the place allows us to display these not features for example population of the state population change what else can we display disease rates all of these things can be stored within the data as an attribute table can be displayed this is what makes software so powerful it is also in this section we also talk about knowing how good quality your data are so making sure we know where to find what types of makes your data better or how do we understand who produced the data what the projection was so we will talk lot about in the last part we talk specifically about the data formats we can use in so there are a lot we are only specifically focusing on five and in this class we really only use or feature classes so make sure that you understand what separates and feature classes feature classes are stored in are not make sure you understand how you understand how each and each feature class is not one file if you open up your open up your window explorer files versus opening it up in you

can support your family if we're going to break the cycle of poverty and opportunity we have to start early and that's what the pupil premium is all about if you're a teacher or a school governor and you're watching this video thinking about how much money this might mean for your school it's really worth asking whether your school has done everything it can do to make sure that every child who's eligible for free school meals is actually registered to receive it now there will always be some families who don't really want the school lunch but it's still worth them being registered for free

a look at one of the most important activities in new eden manufacturing all manufacturing starts with blueprints which can be bought on the market or through contracts be sure to watch the flight

capable of manufacturing it the easiest way to do this is to open the industry window and select the facilities tab you can then filter to find a facility which is accessible to you in this case we will look for a public facility which can handle manufacturing using different facilities will cost different amounts of based on the tax rate set by their owners and the industry system index the industry system index is determined by the amount of industrial activity taking place in the system for example if there is a lot of manufacturing going on then you will be charged more for manufacturing in that system once you have decided on a facility you will need to move your blueprint there but you will need more than just a blueprint to manufacture each blueprint will list what materials and skills are required in the show info window however often easier to right click and select this will show the blueprint in the industry window and show what is needed and how much it costs remember you do not need to own a blueprint in order to view it in the industry window are available in each section for instance if you hover your mouse over the job duration time you can see everything that affects how long your job will take you can see that the duration of the job is reduced by skills implants and even by what facility you use to the left of the window you will see the materials required if you hover over any of the materials you will see the amount you have available at the facility compared to the amount the job will use adjusting the number of items you build will automatically adjust the materials required important to note that you will need to have the materials physically located at the facility if you want to install a job once you have all the materials and enough to cover the cost of the job then the button will change color if the button remains red then hover your mouse over it for a that will let you know what is lacking after the job is installed the button will change to a button so be careful and click with care only click on the start button once or you may accidentally stop your job if a job is stopped all input materials will be lost except for the blueprint the job duration will depend on what you are manufacturing some items such as ammunition can take only a few minutes however some ships can take weeks to build skills play a big part in industry and there are some you should certainly consider if you plan on manufacturing for profit training these skills even to relatively low levels can have a big impact on your manufacturing the progress of active jobs is visible in the jobs tab of the industry window once the job is complete the item automatically appear in your hangar you will need to click on the deliver button to finish the job and deliver the item to the output location you selected when you installed the job now we have a shiny new what shall we do with it perhaps sell it on the market to fund a bigger job maybe fly it yourself or give it to your corporation whatever you do with it remember that every battle you hear about or skirmish that takes place in new eden involves ships made by

complimented the good looks of another woman instead of like my own facial hair but yeah she said she likes the full beard better and i like it too so coming back also i got glasses this is still a little weird not entirely used to it like i keep reaching up to adjust my glasses when they slide down my nose and every time like my god i'm adjusting my so when we moved up here in august i was driving a truck for three days straight and i noticed that when i was driving at night the headlights and tail lights of the other cars were getting a little bit blurry it anything crazy but it was definitely a higher level of blur than i had previously experienced in my life which was like none so the day after my birthday i finally went to the optometrist and found out that i have a mild astigmatism which makes long distance vision a little bit blurry especially at night the optometrist said i only really have to wear them when i'm driving at night but when i put them on everything became so much clearer that i just wear them all the time now the first day i got my glasses i was a little bit down always had perfect vision and so it felt in a sense like i was that but both of my parents had glasses since before i was born so this is not some like huge surprise out of nowhere it was pretty much inevitable and after that first day once gotten used to wearing them i found out that i actually really like how they look i mean for one thing if you tell people a writer i feel like a lot more likely to take you seriously if you do have glasses than if you but also i i know this sounds kind of i feel like the glasses complete my face in this weird way like never really hated the way i look but never thought i was super good looking either and the glasses have definitely caused an improvement in my concept of my own self image whatever worth i know that i chose the best possible frames i might upgrade those at some point and i definitely need to get non glare lenses since as you can see they have a tendency to reflect the lights i use to make my videos but overall yeah i like myself better with glasses than without them there is one other aspect of this whole thing though which is less than completely ideal and that it does make me feel a little old no glasses are not exclusive to old people a lot of kids wear glasses from a very young age my son luke is getting his eyes checked in april because known for a long time that he will almost definitely need glasses growing up and finally of the age where he will probably not break them probably but i born with eyes that needed glasses it happened because i got old which is weird also gonna be real weird every time i go back and watch one of my old videos which i do every once in a while and see myself without the glasses not probably never gonna get over that system shock the way i feel exactly a mid life crisis but kind of akin to one but also made me realize that pretty okay with where i am at this point in my life i make a living as an author got an incredible wife and three wonderful children we got a real nice house in a real nice town in oregon we're probably gonna be getting our own

workers to join and because they join unions many black workers get manufacturing or trade work which paid much better than service work and because they get these jobs black communities had more men out of work higher rates of poverty and more criminal behavior which then allowed the white workers and unions to justify their decision to not allow black workers into their union the prevailing beliefs about race and racism ultimately reinforced themselves this is now known as racial formation theory a theory formalized by modern sociologists michael and howard winant racial formation refers to the process through which social political and economic forces influence how a society defines racial categories and how those racial categories in turn end up shaping those forces and winant argue that the concept of race came about as a tool to justify and maintain the economic and political power held by those of european descent another modern look at these issues can be seen in the work of sociologist william julius wilson he explores why black and white americans tend to have such different outcomes in terms of income education and more and he argues that class not race is the

be talking about how to start a photography business now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really seriously consider what you're doing most people start out in photography as a hobby or something they really enjoy now this is sort of i don't know being a little you know you really want to look at it do i want to start doing something i really enjoy as a pass time and start it in to a business because you might not really enjoy doing it so much anymore where it becomes a business but on the other hand you might actually enjoy doing it more because you're getting paid to do something you enjoy i mean i'm trying to kind of make it a little bit comical but to be really honest with you it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money and in the end i think sometimes that really shows so it's really something you want to think about even before you begin doing anything one thing about a photography business is that photography is extremely expensive so your start up fees are going to be very high but if there's a way that you can make them minimal such as buying equipment that maybe has been used or equipment that is on sale because newer technologies have come out but you could still use that type of equipment for the genre of photography business that you start so those are some aspects that you want to look at it i really frown upon going out and spending a large amount of money on the biggest and the best new equipment to start a business that you've never done before i can i can't think of a bigger mistake a person can potentially make so really start out extremely small take on photography jobs that are really making you a profit of you know not so much at first just enough to almost break even and then start building upon that and building upon your client base and this goes for any type of photography the more specific you are the chances of you making are it are better if you start a photography business specifically aimed at a certain clientele or a certain demographic your chances are better than just starting a photography business where you do everything from weddings to bar to baseball to soccer when you're all over the place there's nothing you can really concentrate on to being the best at that in your area people are going to go to you when you're the only person that does certain type of events or photographs let's say it's dancing i don't know i'm just thinking off the top of my head let's say it's kids dancing you're the best kid photographer in town that does that you're going to get all that business so those are just some ways that i would start a small

the program with very solid strong research skills that allow into you to take those skills either into industry or into an academic job not only do you get a top notch research based education you get to build a connection with faculty that really take an interest in promoting your development ruben the students benefit from the interaction with the professors and this interaction is in the hallway it is not necessarily a formal interaction but as you meet up with the professors you start getting a sense of what i should do in my case because they share ideas or i share my ideas and they give me feedback so the culture is very supportive the culture is very dynamic people are interested when you actually publish something or when you present something and it's always questioning the big why are you doing this now through the process of doing my own research i worked a lot with specific professors and advisors and they helped to refine my thinking about where i wanted to go jamie we've had students investigate a wide variety of issues in the program we've looked at it project management we've had students looking at accountability in public organizations we've had students doing research on leadership in military organizations one of my students is currently investigating the role of psychological capital which is hope optimism confidence and resilience in entrepreneurship and does psychological capital lead to more success among entrepreneurs ruben my research really focuses on project management and the management controls that are used by project managers to be able to create a successful project out of their existing projects my niche is really in organizational leadership but i work at the intersection of a couple of spheres one i work a lot with social entrepreneurship which is something that deals with corporate social responsibility and how to do good in a way that actually creates good business value i also deal in the field of managing organizations and managing projects so i look at that intersection with social entrepreneurship and finally i also look at high technology or information technology and how that impacts how we manage companies how we manage information and how we manage people jamie a lot of the work that we do is very heavily applied and so you can take the skills that you're gaining here and use them either for an academic career or a career in the world of practice ruben i've been able to go through academic conferences overseas and also within canada to be able to present my research i've also been able to participate in award winning papers that have resulted from different aspects of my research my last two papers actually resulted from having participated in research that originated at the university a co author and myself sat together with our advisor and created some research that really delved into conceptually how do students learn that related back again to some of the research i was doing towards organizational leadership jamie what i like the most about working with the students is they're skilled and they're hungry they want to learn it's fun to be involved with them and

and for some reason people start talking funny and killing themselves umm the cause of this is never fully explained umm there are theories that are thrown about and the big theory is pretty silly umm my problem with this movie isn't so much the plot umm it was probably a good idea when m night created it when he thought of it umm but unfortunately most of the time the actors actually find themselves walking or running rather away from the wind they run away from the wind umm if that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out but otherwise don't bother umm the problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious uhh that's probably the best word i can use to describe this movie is just atrocious umm the village and lady in the water were sub par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally but they were at least well made films uhh this i'm surprised this movie actually got any kind of release any kind of distribution the dialogue is horrible umm never really been his strong suit but he usually casts decent enough actors or at least gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it uhh with bruce willis or mel gibson umm paul giamatti uhh bryce dallas howard they're all decent actors in his movies umm i don't know if it was teaming up with mark wahlberg who has is notoriously stutter wooden actor i don't know if that hurt the film or not but he also did not get anything out of john or who are usually pretty fine actors themselves so i don't know what exactly happened here but the acting it feels like the words are being read off of a script as you're watching the movie it looks like they're actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time that's how the delivery is and it doesn't help that the words they're delivering are just dumb umm i almost walked out of the movie but i wanted to stay till the end i wanted to see how it wrapped up umm the beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves it's towards the very beginning of the film uhh that was the first real sign of trouble for me was the acting by the lead construction worker and from there it just went downhill and it went really over the top when uhh they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her which is horrible product placement and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit obviously bad just terribly done terribly delivered dialogue while they're watching it it's just an awful movie i'm only gonna give this one one out of five stars i don't recommend anybody ever seeing this uhh this is the kind of movie that's gonna to be ridiculed in five years on by drunken boys because it's just that awful umm i was really

is a really powerful technique for overcoming challenges this is called my question technique when challenges come along when things come along when challenges come along firstly i don't call them problems i refer to them as challenges and the second thing is i turn them into a question so yesterday i went to a breakfast meeting with someone and when i got there he'd already eaten his breakfast and then he talked to me for the next minutes about his business and i was getting very very hungry he didn't offer tea or coffee or breakfast or anything and by the end we shook hands and i left i didn't enjoy the meeting at all create an agenda so the question i ask from this challenge is how do i avoid being in this situation again and what i do is i come up with the answer i create a need for an agenda so when someone wants to meet me with my valuable time and they want to suck my brain then what i'm going to do is ask the agenda or say hey what's the meeting about where are we meeting when we're there is it a breakfast meeting or is it just a coffee and i want to make sure because i could have eaten breakfast before i went to this meeting had i known that it was a fake breakfast meeting the big deal so here's the big deal when you've got challenges in your business ask yourself the question the best tool that i use for this is a i put up on the top of the the question and then i answer it or i might even ask for help from my friends or peers question for today so the question today might be how do i drive extra traffic to my business or how do i drive extra traffic to my business without using or how do i convert more of the traffic that comes to my website or how do i convert more of the traffic that comes to my website without changing the offer in other words how do i improve the or the conversion process or i could say how do i improve the conversions for traffic coming to my by changing the offer and not changing the layout of the site this forces clarity it forces innovation and hopefully it's a self diagnostic questioning technique that's going to grow your business your action step for today i'm james i hope you've enjoyed this today's action step of course is to go and ask yourself a hard hitting question see if you can get a good answer and then implement it and see what results you get<sep><cls>\n","tensor([[1.0000, 1.6667,

certificate of deposit if you choose not to borrow against it will grow with a rate of interest that's declared by the bank make sure you look for the very best rate that's available because banks are

speaking before this is memorized which means you have no notes you have no cue cards you have no nothing all of it has to memorized and it is imperative that it is memorized you could do it in your sleep you know you don't even have to think about it because what happens when you go into performance or you go in and do this monologue in front of other people that element of the person will totally throw you and if the monologue is not memorized solidly you'll lose your place you'll be floundering for words a couple of great tips for memorizing monologues do it one line at a time say the first line well well well i never thought you'd show up then say the second line i had intended to come ok then say them all together well well well i never thought you'd show up i had intended to come then add the third line that's one great trick another great trick is add movement because the movement will actually help you remember the words so instead of just sitting down and learning the words walk around as you say them well well well i never thought you'd show up well well well i never thought you'd show up by putting a movement with it your body can connect to it better so if your body can't remember the words your body can remember the movement which will then bring up the words cool huh another thing you can do is you can lay down lay down and recite it line by line or section by section face a mirror recite it line by line or section by section the one thing you don't want to do is try to take on memorizing the whole thing at one time it will be way too overwhelming if you don't want to break it in lines break it into sections work on one section at a time get it solid i also recommend memorize the first part first and the last part last then

mother step father and siblings but was kicked out of the house for about a year by her step father her family life too great as her father abuses her mother and verbally abuses her since she is the new girl eleanor has no place to sit on the bus but park eventually lets her sit next to him as weeks go by park and eleanor develop a friendship based on their love of music and comics they eventually talk to each other every day on the bus to and from school one day they start holding hands and their feelings for each other blossom into a romance their relationship develops from hand holding to kissing but several conflicts come up along the way including eleanor discovering perverted messages in her schoolbooks and park bringing up a past relationship with a popular girl during the holiday break eleanor spends more time with park and his family nearly going to his house every day mother even offers to give her a free makeover although eleanor really like it their relationship begins to get more physical but step father discovers her relationship with park and is upset eleanor also figures out that her step father has been the one writing those perverted messages in her books eleanor decides to run away and park takes her to her house in minnesota they say good bye but park promises to write letters however eleanor decides not to read them or write back in the end life goes on for both eleanor and park but she finally writes back after over a year of silence as always a lot can be said about this story but what draws my interest and attention is the idea that while asian women are sometimes portrayed in the media as desirable we really see a lot if any asian men as objects of desire this idea is introduced when park struggles with his masculinity in the story as he experiments with eyeliner he feels undesirable in a way because he identifies himself as asian and he sees a lack of asian men in the media as desirable i was never aware of this until graduate school in college when i heard a professor talk about how asian men are often in western culture as weak or submissive and while there have been asian men who have been action heroes like bruce lee and jackie chan more viewed as weapons or comic relief not necessarily as romantic love interests the identity of asian men in our culture is not a big theme in this story yet the author was aware of the issue enough to bring it up one of the issues that park continues to struggle with even as he pursues eleanor and what makes this story exciting there are two imperfect people trying to make a relationship work both are worried about perception and why the other person would want to be with them eleanor for her size and lack of femininity park for his low self esteem
